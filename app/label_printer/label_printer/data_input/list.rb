    ##
    # A special type of list.
    # To make the labels easy to find they are added to a hash.
    # Label names are duplicated and adding these to a normal hash will cause data loss.
    # Therefore each name is made unique by adding an integer to the end e.g. my_label_1
    # We still need to find these by the key without the integer so this type of list adds
    # various methods to support that.
    # This list also supports the Commands::Outputter so it can be turned into formatted
    # text for the label printer.
